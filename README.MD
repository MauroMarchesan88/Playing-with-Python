# Playing-with-Python

This is a repo with things i find interesting, parts of tutorials, or something i just want to save while learning Python

Im sure there will be little programs and thigs i find interesting, maybe some of them will be more complex, but the main idea for this repo is to save my adventures.

Think of this as a diary/resource for fundamentals.
